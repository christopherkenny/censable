`censable` wraps `censusapi` for common requests, with [memoized](https://github.com/r-lib/memoise) data functions. With a growing redistricting universe in R, it seems right to partition out some use cases, to allow imports to be more targeted and to stop packages from repeating each other.

It currently uses the `censusapi` package, but plans to return to using `tidycensus` after the `r-spatial` reformulates.

## Installation

You can install the released version of censable from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("censable")
```
You can download the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("christopherkenny/censable")
```
## Example
```{r}
library(censable)
```

The primary data functions are `build_dec` and `build_acs`
```{r, results='hide'}
de <- build_dec(geography = 'county', state = 'DE')
```
The `build_*` functions take arguments on geography and state, at a minimum. If you're looking at a smaller piece of a state, you can use `county` to subset it. Year defaults to 2010, but will be updated to 2020 around October 2021, following the API release of the 2020 Census data.

The `build_*` functions are a convenient wrapper around `censusapi`, with an eye towards collecting data on total population and voting age population by race. Total population variables begin with the prefix `pop`, while voting age population variables begin with the prefix `vap`. 

Additionally, there are memoised versions of the `build_*` functions:
```{r, results='hide'}
de <- mem_build_dec(geography = 'county', state = 'DE')
```
These speed up repeated calls, allowing you to have code that is self contained and reproducible, without taking the time hit of having to re-download the data each time.
